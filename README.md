# Rose
A cross-platform toolkit for Road user trajectory analysis

The toolkit takes the trajectory output from an AI-enabled model and captures a pair of road user interactions. The objective is to provide a unified interface for the user to advance from being able to extract the interactions and acquire insights from individual interactions.

The result will foster a new way of ML modeling, a better understanding of traffic dynamics, and improve traffic safety.
