\title{The First Day Data of Belle Isle Road and Queesnway}
\usage{
data(belle); data(queensway)
}
\description{
The dataset stores the trajectories of various road users in the two 
locations in Leeds. Two cameras were installed on two street poles in
the two investigated sites at the heights, respectively of 6.46 m and 8.3 m.
The data frame has eight columns: 
    \enumerate{
      \item ID is the unique track ID for one road user All rows
      with same ID belong to the same road user.
      \item Time is the time stamp.
      \item X and Y record the 2-D coordinate system for a sample, which 
      is an estimate of the centre of a road user.
      The figures show the rendered ground images, including the 
      origin and the orientation of the coordinate system. Belle Road image
      stretches from -24.77 to 24.77 metres horizontally (left to right) 
      and -38.02 to 38.02 metres vertically (upper to down). Similarly,
      Queensway image was scaled horizontally from -47.65 to 47.65 metres 
      and vertically from -42.27 to 42.27 metres.

      \if{html}{\figure{queensway.png}{options: width=100 alt="queensway"}}
      \if{latex}{\figure{queensway.png}{options: width=0.5in}}
      
      \item Speed – speed at current time/position. Unit: km/h
      \item Type – object class. \itemize{
        \item 0 = Pedestrian
        \item 1 = Bicycle
        \item 2 = Light Vehicle
        \item 3 = Heavy Vehicle
      }
      \item Estimated is a Boolean value, indicating that whether
      a sample is an actual measurement (
      Estimated = 0) or deduced from a prediction (Estimated = 1). The 
      sensor predicted a value in two situations
      \itemize{
        \item The object had just entered the field of view and the 
        track has not confirmed yet.
        \item The object was temporarily occluded or there was a
        temporary missed detection.
      }
      \item fid is file id. 1 to 7 for Belle Isle Road. 1 to 8 for Queensway.
    }
}
\details{
The datasets only load the first-day record. The complete data are in 
  the \code{tests/extdata} folder. The sensors associated with Belle Isle 
  Road started to collect data from May, 9, 2022, 08:50 PM to May, 15,
  2022, 08:05 AM. The other location started from May, 17, 2022, 11:17 AM 
  to May, 23, 2022, 04:05 PM.
  
  From Kim Bergvall (Viscando project manager):
  \itemize{
  \item "Queensway. Due to sensor problems, A0300143 (blue ROI) was activated 
  2022-05-17 11:18 (local time) A0300130 was activated 2022-05-16 
  21:44 (local time). To compensate for this, the measurement was prolonged 
  until 2022-05-23"
  \item "We have put some effort in the algorithm for fusing tracks of vehicles, but this updated algorithm is not applied to tracks of pedestrians and bicycles."
  }
  [Editor note] I guess Kim's fusing meant "joining".
